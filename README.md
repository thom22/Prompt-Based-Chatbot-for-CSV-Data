# Prompt Based Data Analysis and Visualization Chatbot for CSV Data

- This Chatbot is a streamlit Web app that performs data analysis and data visualization with simple chat and conversations. The basic idea behind the app is to translate the user text inputs into dataframe
  queries using Large language model (LLM), facilitated by PandasAI, and display the results through an interactive Streamlit web app.

  
 To get started, install the requirements file as follows
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the streamlit app in your terminal 

```python
streamlit run app.py
```
